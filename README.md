# 🧠 React Quiz App

Welcome to the React **Quiz App**, a dynamic and **responsive** quiz platform built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. It allows users to test their knowledge across multiple categories with smooth transitions, score tracking, and now — a review section to check correct and incorrect answers after completing the quiz.

The project ensures a great user experience, supporting both light and dark themes along with automatic scroll-to-top on every route change or navigation.
